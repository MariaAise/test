        "# Prompting with Gemini\n",
        "Prompting with Gemini is a powerful technique for leveraging Google's multimodal LLMs to generate text, code, or structured outputs across diverse tasks. Whether you're classifying survey responses, drafting brand strategy briefs, or building interactive agents, effective prompting helps guide the model toward accurate, domain-aligned results. This tutorial walks you through zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought prompting patterns tailored for high-impact use cases in business, research, and product workflows."

            "*   **Stars:**  Massive, luminous spheres of plasma held together by their own gravity. Stars produce energy through nuclear fusion (converting hydrogen into helium). They eventually die in various ways, such as becoming white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes.\n",
            "*   **Planets:**  Celestial bodies that orbit stars. They don't produce their own light but reflect the light of their star.\n",
            "*   **Moons:** Natural satellites that orbit planets.\n",
            "*   **Asteroids, Comets, and Meteors:**  Rocky or icy bodies that orbit the Sun.\n",

            "*   **Black Holes:**  Regions of spacetime with such strong gravity that nothing, not even light, can escape. They are formed by the collapse of massive stars.\n",
            "*   **Dark Matter:**  A mysterious substance that makes up about 85% of the matter in the universe. We can't see it directly, but we know it's there because of its gravitational effects.\n",

            "*   **The Big Freeze (Heat Death):** The universe continues to expand and cool, eventually running out of usable energy.  Stars will burn out, and everything will gradually approach a state of maximum entropy.\n",
            "*   **The Big Crunch:**  The expansion of the universe slows down and eventually reverses, causing the universe to collapse back into a singularity.  This is less favored due to the observed acceleration of the universe's expansion.\n",

        "Chain-of-Thought prompting is a technique where you instruct the model to output intermediate reasoning steps, and it typically gets better results, especially when combined with few-shot examples. It is worth noting that this technique doesn't completely eliminate hallucinations, and that it tends to cost more to run, due to the increased token count.\n",

        "Models like the Gemini family are trained to be \"chatty\" or \"thoughtful\" and will provide reasoning steps without prompting, so for this simple example you can ask the model to be more direct in the prompt to force a non-reasoning response. Try re-running this step if the model gets lucky and gets the answer correct on the first try."

The explicit mention of 'for Asia' ties the critique to a specific cultural and geographical context, indicating a perceived lack of cultural resonance or modernity in a key market for the styling element. While not outright rejecting the brand, the strong negative point about styling being 'outdated' in a strategic region represents opposition to the current product direction's relevance in that market. The feedback implies the styling does not align with contemporary expectations or trends in Asia, which is critical information for a luxury brand aiming for global relevance. The core message is a negative assessment of a key product attribute (styling) within a specific market context, outweighing the initial positive comment and categorizing it as feedback that opposes the current design strategy's effectiveness in that region.\"\n}\n```"
